# cloud-computing-project
The objective of this project is to design and implement a Kubernetes-based micro-services
architecture to gain practical experience in container orchestration. The project includes:
1. Creating at least three deployments (two for front-end micro-services and one for the back-end
database). 2. Configuring Kubernetes services, including one external and two internal services. 3. Storing sensitive data using configuration maps and secrets. 4. Utilizing Docker containers and creating custom Docker images. 5. Documenting the implementation for reproducibility
